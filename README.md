# Machine-learning-Prediction-model


The provided Python code focuses on building a linear regression model for predicting the price of Airbnb listings based on selected features. Here's a concise summary of the code:

Import Libraries:

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn libraries are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
Load Dataset:

The Airbnb dataset is loaded from the specified path, and basic information about the dataset is displayed using df.info().
Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Rows with missing values are dropped.
A subset of features is selected for analysis.
Data Visualization:

A pairplot is created for visualizing relationships between selected features.
Feature Selection:

A correlation heatmap is generated to identify relevant features based on their correlation with the target variable ('price').
Model Training:

Features and the target variable are selected, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A linear regression model is trained on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Predictions are made on the test set, and mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared values are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
Visualization:

A scatter plot is created to visualize the predicted prices against the actual prices in the test set.
In summary, this code demonstrates a linear regression model for predicting Airbnb listing prices based on selected features. It includes data exploration, cleaning, visualization, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the model's predictions.
